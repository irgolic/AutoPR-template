## Weather App

We have implemented a weather app that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather conditions for a user-selected location. The app features a simple, visually appealing UI and includes a user manual in markdown format.

For more information and usage instructions, please refer to [USER_MANUAL.md](https://github.com/irgolic/AutoPR/blob/main/weather-app/USER_MANUAL.md).

# Tech Jargon Generator

This project includes a Python script called `tech_jargon_generator.py` that combines random words from three lists (verbs, adjectives, and nouns) to create funny and creative tech jargon phrases. The script also includes a test function that verifies the output has the correct format.

## Usage Instructions

To use the tech jargon generator, simply run the `tech_jargon_generator.py` script. A random tech jargon phrase will be generated and printed to the console.

If you'd like to try out GPT-4 AutoPR, you can make an issue in this repository, and I'll run it manually.
